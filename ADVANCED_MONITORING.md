# Advanced Monitoring & Observability

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Strategy

### Application Metrics
- **Custom business metrics** for user engagement
- **Performance counters** for critical operations
- **Error rate tracking** with categorization
- **Resource utilization** monitoring (CPU, Memory, I/O)

### Distributed Tracing
- **Request tracing** across all service boundaries
- **Database query tracing** with performance analysis
- **External service call tracing** (file storage, email)
- **Error propagation tracking** through the stack

### Logging Enhancement
- **Structured logging** with consistent format
- **Request correlation IDs** for request tracking
- **Security audit logs** for compliance
- **Performance timing logs** for optimization

### Alerting Framework
- **Smart alerting** to reduce noise
- **Escalation policies** for critical issues
- **Integration** with PagerDuty/Slack
- **Automated incident creation** for tracking

## ðŸš€ Implementation Stack

### Metrics Collection
- **Prometheus** for metrics storage
- **Grafana** for visualization dashboards
- **Custom collectors** for business metrics
- **Health check endpoints** expansion

### Logging Infrastructure
- **Structured JSON logging** with Winston
- **Log aggregation** with ELK Stack
- **Log retention policies** for compliance
- **Real-time log streaming** for debugging

### Tracing System
- **OpenTelemetry** integration
- **Jaeger** for trace visualization
- **Service map generation** for architecture insight
- **Performance bottleneck identification**

### Dashboards
- **Executive dashboard** with business KPIs
- **Operational dashboard** for system health
- **Security dashboard** for threat monitoring
- **Performance dashboard** for optimization

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics to Track

### Business Metrics
- User registration conversion rates
- Document upload success rates
- Authentication failure patterns
- Feature adoption analytics

### Technical Metrics
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query performance
- Error rates by endpoint
- System resource utilization

### Security Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts
- Privilege escalation events
- Unusual access patterns
- Data access audit trails

This comprehensive monitoring solution will provide deep insights into
application performance, user behavior, and system health, enabling
proactive issue resolution and data-driven optimization decisions.
